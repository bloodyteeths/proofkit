# HACCP Food Safety Datasets

## Overview
This directory contains food safety cooling specifications and temperature monitoring datasets for HACCP (Hazard Analysis Critical Control Points) systems. Data follows FDA Food Code and FSIS requirements.

## Documents

### raw/FDA_Cooling_Cooked_Time_Temperature.pdf
**Source**: FDA Food Code guidance document  
**Standard**: FDA Food Code §3-501.14 Cooling  
**Content**: Time/temperature control requirements for safely cooling cooked foods

### raw/FDA_Food_Code_2017.pdf
**Source**: FDA Food Code 2017 complete document  
**Standard**: FDA Food Code comprehensive guidance  
**Content**: Complete food safety regulations including HACCP requirements

## Critical Control Points

### Two-Stage Cooling Process
**Stage 1**: Cool from 135°F (57°C) to 70°F (21°C) within 2 hours  
**Stage 2**: Cool from 70°F (21°C) to 41°F (5°C) within 4 hours  
**Total Time**: Maximum 6 hours from 135°F to 41°F

### Temperature Danger Zone
- **Range**: 41°F to 135°F (5°C to 57°C)
- **Risk**: Bacterial doubling time as little as 20 minutes
- **Objective**: Minimize time in danger zone

## HACCP Principles Applied
1. **Hazard Analysis**: Pathogenic bacteria growth during cooling
2. **Critical Control Point**: Cooling time/temperature relationship
3. **Critical Limits**: 135°F→70°F in 2hr, 70°F→41°F in 4hr
4. **Monitoring**: Continuous temperature logging
5. **Corrective Actions**: Rapid cooling methods, product disposal
6. **Verification**: Calibrated thermometer validation
7. **Record Keeping**: Temperature logs and corrective action documentation

## Cooling Methods
- Ice baths for small portions
- Shallow pans (2-inch depth maximum)
- Refrigerated storage below 41°F
- Blast chilling equipment
- Ice wands for liquids
- Divided portions for large batches

## Quality Specifications
- Temperature measurement: ±1°F accuracy
- Logging interval: Every 30 minutes during cooling
- Probe placement: Thickest part of food item
- Calibration: Daily thermometer verification

## Regulatory Compliance
- FDA Food Code: Comprehensive food safety requirements
- FSIS 9 CFR 417: HACCP systems for meat/poultry
- USDA FSIS: Safe minimum internal temperatures
- State and local health department variations
- FSMA Preventive Controls Rule

## Common Violations
- Extended cooling times beyond 6-hour limit
- Inadequate temperature monitoring
- Large portions cooling too slowly
- Lack of corrective action documentation
- Improper cooling method selection
- Equipment malfunction during cooling cycle

## Notes
Documents provide comprehensive guidance for establishing HACCP cooling procedures in food service operations. Critical for preventing foodborne illness outbreaks and maintaining regulatory compliance. Temperature monitoring during cooling is one of the most frequently cited violations in food safety inspections.
