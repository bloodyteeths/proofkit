# ProofKit Example: Powder Coat Cure with Data Gaps (Sensor Disconnection)
# Job: Decorative furniture coating batch PWC-2024-003
# Equipment: Dual PMT Sensor Array (TC-200 series)
# Date: 2024-01-15
# Description: Data gaps exceeding allowed threshold due to sensor disconnection during cure
# Expected Result: FAIL - data gaps too large for verification
