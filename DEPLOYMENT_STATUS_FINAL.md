## ‚ö†Ô∏è Pending Configuration

### Required: Stripe Environment Variables
The payment system is fully implemented but needs Stripe configuration:

```bash
# Run this command to configure Stripe:
./scripts/setup_production_secrets.sh
```

You'll need from your Stripe Dashboard:
1. **API Keys** (https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys)
   - Secret Key (sk_live_... or sk_test_...)
   - Publishable Key (pk_live_... or pk_test_...)

2. **Webhook Secret** (https://dashboard.stripe.com/webhooks)
   - Create endpoint: https://www.proofkit.net/api/pay/webhook
   - Select events: checkout.session.completed, invoice.payment_succeeded

3. **Price IDs** (create products first)
   - Starter Plan: ‚Ç¨14/month
   - Pro Plan: ‚Ç¨59/month
   - Business Plan: ‚Ç¨199/month

## üöÄ Current Production Status

- **App Status**: Running on Fly.io (3d8d3260a29678)
- **Domain**: https://www.proofkit.net
- **Health Checks**: 1 passing, 2 warnings
- **Email**: Postmark configured and working
- **Authentication**: Magic links working
- **Quota Enforcement**: Active for free tier

## üìã Quick Test Checklist

After configuring Stripe:

1. **Test Authentication**
   ```
   ‚úÖ Visit https://www.proofkit.net
   ‚úÖ Sign up with magic link
   ‚úÖ Receive email and verify
   ‚úÖ See username in navigation
   ```

2. **Test Quota System**
   ```
   ‚úÖ Generate 2 certificates (free tier)
   ‚úÖ Try 3rd certificate - should show upgrade prompt
   ‚úÖ Click upgrade to see pricing page
   ```

3. **Test Payment Flow**
   ```
   ‚è≥ Select a paid plan
   ‚è≥ Complete Stripe checkout
   ‚è≥ Verify plan upgrade
   ‚è≥ Check increased quota
   ```

4. **Test Dashboard**
   ```
   ‚è≥ Visit /dashboard when logged in
   ‚è≥ See usage statistics
   ‚è≥ View recent reports
   ‚è≥ Check current plan details
   ```

## üéØ Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Run `./scripts/setup_production_secrets.sh` to configure Stripe
2. **Test**: Complete payment flow with test card (4242 4242 4242 4242)
3. **Monitor**: Check Stripe webhook events dashboard
4. **Verify**: Dashboard loads correctly after Stripe configuration

## üí° Important Notes

- The dashboard authentication error was caused by missing Stripe imports
- Fallback mechanisms are now in place for graceful degradation
- All core functionality works without Stripe (free tier)
- Payment features activate once Stripe is configured

## üîß Troubleshooting

If dashboard still shows errors after Stripe setup:
1. Check logs: `flyctl logs --app proofkit-prod`
2. Verify secrets: `flyctl secrets list --app proofkit-prod`
3. Test locally with same environment variables
4. Ensure webhook endpoint is accessible

## ‚ú® Summary

The authentication and quota systems are fully functional. The payment integration is complete but awaits Stripe configuration. Once you run the setup script and configure Stripe, the entire user funnel from landing to payment will be operational.
