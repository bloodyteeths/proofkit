# Golden hash for ProofKit powder coating plot generation
# Generated from min_powder.csv fixture with min_powder_spec.json
# Using matplotlib Agg backend with PROOFKIT_TEST=1 environment
# 
# This hash represents the expected SHA-256 of a deterministic plot PNG
# generated for powder coating cure validation with standard test data.
#
# Test data: 20 rows of temperature data ranging from 168-174°C
# Target: 170°C, Conservative threshold: 172°C
# Expected result: PASS with sufficient hold time
#
# Hash generated on: 2025-08-05
# Test environment: matplotlib Agg backend, antialiasing disabled
# Plot dimensions: 12x8 inches at 100 DPI
