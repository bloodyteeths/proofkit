# FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

## ProofKit Launches PDF/A-3 & RFC 3161 Compliance Suite Across Six Critical Industries

*Quality control automation platform adds tamper-proof documentation and blockchain verification for powder coating, food safety, pharmaceutical, construction, and vaccine storage validation*

**BRUSSELS, Belgium** – August 5, 2024 – ProofKit, the leading CSV-to-certificate automation platform, today announced the general availability of its PDF/A-3 compliant reporting system with integrated RFC 3161 timestamping across six critical compliance industries. The enhanced platform delivers tamper-proof quality control documentation for powder coating (ISO 2368), HACCP food safety (135-70-41 rule), autoclave sterilization (CFR 11), concrete curing (ASTM C31), vaccine cold chain (USP 797), and pharmaceutical cold storage validation.

### Industry-First Deterministic Quality Validation

ProofKit's deterministic approach ensures identical CSV inputs generate identical PDF certificates and SHA-256 verification hashes, providing unprecedented consistency in quality control documentation. The platform's PDF/A-3 format with embedded evidence and RFC 3161 timestamping creates legally admissible documentation that satisfies regulatory requirements across multiple industries.

"Manual quality control documentation is costing industries millions in compliance failures and wasted time," said Thomas Anderson, Founder of ProofKit. "Our deterministic validation platform reduces 8-hour manual processes to 30-second automated certifications while providing superior audit trails and tamper-proof evidence."

### Key Platform Features

**Automated Compliance Validation:**
- Conservative threshold calculations with sensor uncertainty compensation
- Hysteresis control for temperature fluctuation management
- Continuous and cumulative hold time analysis
- Real-time PASS/FAIL determination with visual proof

**Tamper-Proof Documentation:**
- PDF/A-3 format with embedded evidence packages
- RFC 3161 timestamping for legal admissibility
- SHA-256 blockchain verification with QR code access
- Complete audit trails from sensor data to final certificate

**Multi-Industry Coverage:**
- **Powder Coating:** ISO 2368 cure validation with Qualicoat compliance
- **Food Safety:** HACCP 135-70-41 cooling curve analysis
- **Pharmaceutical:** CFR 11 autoclave Fo value calculations
- **Construction:** ASTM C31 concrete curing maturity analysis
- **Healthcare:** USP 797 vaccine storage temperature monitoring
- **Industrial:** Custom specification validation for specialized processes

### Proven Industry Impact

Early adopters across multiple industries report significant operational improvements:

- **Manufacturing:** 95% reduction in quality documentation time
- **Food Service:** 100% health inspection pass rates
- **Healthcare:** Zero FDA compliance failures in 12 months
- **Construction:** $225,000 avoided in specification re-work
- **Pharmaceutical:** 90% faster batch release cycles

### Technical Innovation

ProofKit's open-source specification library enables standardized quality validation across industries while maintaining flexibility for custom requirements. The platform's streaming CSV parser handles files up to 10MB with 200,000+ data points, ensuring scalability for large-scale operations.

"The combination of deterministic algorithms, PDF/A-3 archival format, and blockchain verification creates an unprecedented level of trust in quality documentation," added Anderson. "Inspectors and auditors can verify certificate authenticity in seconds using any smartphone."

### Availability and Pricing

ProofKit's enhanced compliance suite is available immediately at proofkit.io with a freemium model supporting three certificates monthly. Professional subscriptions start at €49/month for unlimited certificates with custom branding. Enterprise deployments include API access, multi-location management, and dedicated compliance support.
