#### Thread 1: Problem-Focused (Pre-Launch)
```
🧵 THREAD: Why quality managers are ditching Excel for audits (1/8)

1/ Excel spreadsheets are the #1 cause of quality audit failures.

Here's what goes wrong:
❌ Manual calculation errors
❌ No tamper-proof evidence  
❌ Inconsistent methodologies
❌ Auditor skepticism

2/ Real examples from recent audits:

"Temperature threshold calculations contain formula errors" - Qualicoat audit report

"Sterilization records show evidence of post-processing modification" - FDA 483 citation

"Fo value calculations cannot be independently verified" - Medical device inspection

3/ The cost is massive:

→ Failed powder coat audit: €15,000 re-certification + 6 week delay
→ CFR 11 violation: €500,000+ remediation + manufacturing hold
→ Quality manager stress: Priceless 😅

4/ Next week, I'm showing the solution:

📅 Thu 8/15: Qualicoat automation demo
📅 Fri 8/16: CFR 11 compliance demo

Both free, both 20 minutes, both game-changing.

5/ What you'll see:
→ Raw CSV upload to audit-proof certificate in 30s
→ Tamper-proof verification any auditor can check
→ Zero manual calculations, zero human error

6/ Who should attend:
✓ Quality managers facing audits
✓ QA professionals using Excel for validation
✓ Anyone tired of compliance stress

7/ Registration is free:
[WEBINAR_LINK]

Bonus: 3 free certificates to test with your own data afterward.

8/ Stop letting Excel ruin your audits.

Join 2,000+ quality professionals who've already made the switch.
