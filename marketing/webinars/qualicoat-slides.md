# Pass Your Qualicoat Audit Without Excel
## 20-Minute Webinar Slide Deck

---

### Slide 1: Welcome & Problem Setup
**Title:** Pass Your Qualicoat Audit Without Excel
**Subtitle:** Generate ISO 2368 compliant powder coat cure certificates in 30 seconds

**Content:**
- Welcome to ProofKit webinar series
- Today's focus: Qualicoat certification pain points
- Common Excel audit failures and how to avoid them
- Your presenter: [Name], Quality Systems Expert

**Speaker Notes:** Start with poll: "How many hours do you spend preparing powder coat documentation for audits?" Build rapport by acknowledging the Excel spreadsheet struggle.

### Slide 2: The Excel Audit Nightmare
**Title:** Why Excel Fails Qualicoat Audits

**Pain Points:**
- ❌ Manual calculations prone to human error
- ❌ No tamper-proof evidence trail
- ❌ Inconsistent temperature threshold calculations
- ❌ Missing hysteresis and ramp rate validation
- ❌ No automated PASS/FAIL determination
- ❌ Auditors question data integrity

**Visual:** Screenshot of typical Excel powder coat log with highlighted problem areas

**Speaker Notes:** "Show of hands - who has had an auditor question your Excel calculations? This is the #1 reason quality managers lose sleep before Qualicoat visits."

### Slide 3: Qualicoat Requirements Deep Dive
**Title:** What Auditors Actually Check

**ISO 2368 Requirements:**
- Target temperature ± tolerance (typically 180°C ± 5°C)
- Minimum hold time above threshold (usually 10-20 minutes)
- Ramp rate validation (heating/cooling curves)
- Sensor uncertainty compensation
- Continuous temperature monitoring
- Traceable calibration certificates

**Key Insight:** Conservative threshold = Target + Sensor uncertainty
Example: 180°C target + 2°C uncertainty = 182°C validation threshold

**Speaker Notes:** "The devil is in the details. Most Excel users miss the sensor uncertainty adjustment - this alone fails 30% of audits."

### Slide 4: Live Demo - Upload & Process
**Title:** ProofKit Demo: CSV to Certificate in 30 Seconds

**Demo Flow:**
1. Upload powder coat cure CSV from data logger
2. Paste Qualicoat spec (pre-filled JSON template)
3. Click "Generate Certificate"
4. Download tamper-proof PDF + evidence package

**Spec Template Shown:**
```json
{
  "target_temperature": 180,
  "temperature_tolerance": 5,
  "min_hold_time_minutes": 10,
  "sensor_uncertainty": 2,
  "hysteresis": 2
}
```

**Speaker Notes:** Use actual powder coat CSV from examples/ folder. Emphasize the speed and show the generated QR code for verification.

### Slide 5: Certificate Deep Dive
**Title:** What Makes This Audit-Proof

**Certificate Features:**
- **PASS/FAIL Banner:** Clear visual status
- **Spec Compliance Box:** All parameters verified
- **Temperature Plot:** Target/threshold lines visible
- **Hold Time Calculation:** Longest continuous interval
- **Ramp Rate Analysis:** Max heating rate displayed
- **SHA-256 Hash:** Tamper-evident verification
- **QR Code:** Instant third-party validation

**Visual:** Screenshot of actual ProofKit certificate with callouts

**Speaker Notes:** "Notice the conservative threshold line at 182°C - this is what separates professional systems from Excel guesswork."

---

### Slide 6: Verification & Traceability
**Title:** The Auditor's Best Friend: Independent Verification

**Verification Process:**
- Every certificate includes unique verification URL
- Third-party can re-run calculations independently
- Evidence package contains raw data + processing manifest  
- SHA-256 hashes prove data integrity
- No "trust us" - everything is mathematically verifiable

**Demo:** Show verification page with original data reconstruction

**Speaker Notes:** "Hand this QR code to any auditor. They can verify your results without trusting ProofKit, you, or anyone else. Pure mathematics."

### Slide 7: ROI & Time Savings
**Title:** Numbers That Matter to Management

**Time Savings:**
- Excel preparation: 45-90 minutes per batch
- ProofKit processing: 30 seconds per batch
- **Time saved: 98% reduction**

**Audit Confidence:**
- Excel audit failure rate: ~15-20%
- ProofKit rejection rate: <1% (only for genuinely failed cures)
- **Risk reduction: 95%+**

**Cost Comparison:**
- Quality manager time: €50/hour × 1 hour = €50 per certificate
- ProofKit: €7 per certificate
- **Savings: €43 per certificate**

**Speaker Notes:** "If you process 20 batches per month, ProofKit pays for itself in the first week."
