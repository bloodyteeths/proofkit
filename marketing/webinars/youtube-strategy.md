## Custom Thumbnails Strategy

### Design Elements:
- **Color Scheme:** ProofKit brand colors (blue/white) for consistency
- **Text Overlay:** Key benefit (e.g., "30 Second Certificates")
- **Visual Elements:** Before/after split screen (Excel chaos vs. ProofKit certificate)
- **Faces:** Include presenter face for human connection
- **Urgency:** Use words like "NEW", "DEMO", "FREE" where appropriate

### Qualicoat Thumbnail Variations:
1. **Split Screen:** Excel spreadsheet (left) vs. Professional certificate (right)
2. **Problem/Solution:** Confused quality manager + "EXCEL FAILS" vs. Happy manager + "PASSES EVERY TIME"
3. **Time Savings:** Stopwatch showing "30 SECONDS" with Qualicoat logo
4. **Authority:** Presenter pointing at certificate with "ISO 2368 EXPERT" badge

### CFR 11 Thumbnail Variations:
1. **Regulatory Focus:** FDA logo + "COMPLIANT" checkmark
2. **Process Visual:** Raw data → ProofKit → FDA certificate flow
3. **Authority:** "CFR 11 SPECIALIST" with pharmaceutical imagery
4. **Problem/Solution:** "AUDIT FAILURES" vs. "100% PASS RATE"
