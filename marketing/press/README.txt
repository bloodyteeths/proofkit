About ProofKit
--------------
ProofKit is a specialized quality assurance tool that transforms CSV temperature data into compliant, tamper-evident certificates for industrial processes. Our system serves critical industries including powder coating, food safety (HACCP), pharmaceutical cold chain, medical device sterilization, and construction concrete curing.

Key Differentiators
------------------
• Deterministic Processing: Identical inputs always produce identical PDFs and hashes
• Cryptographic Integrity: SHA-256 manifests with embedded evidence files
• Industry Standards: PDF/A-3 archival format with RFC 3161 timestamping
• Zero Persistence: Data processed in memory, never stored on servers
• Multi-Industry Support: Pre-built specifications for 5+ industries
• Instant Verification: Public portal to validate any certificate authenticity
