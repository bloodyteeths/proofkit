# ProofKit Case Study: Concrete Curing Validation
*One-Page PDF Template for Construction Industry Outreach*

---

## Client Success Story

**Company:** BuildRight Construction (Commercial Contractor)  
**Challenge:** Manual ASTM C31 curing log creation for 50+ pours monthly  
**Solution:** ProofKit automated temperature-time compliance validation  
**Result:** 85% time savings, zero specification failures, improved project timelines  

---

## The Challenge

> "Every concrete pour required detailed curing logs for ASTM C31 compliance. Our field crews were spending hours creating temperature charts, calculating degree-days, and preparing documentation for structural engineers. Manual errors led to specification failures and expensive re-pours."
> 
> **— Michael Torres, Project Manager, BuildRight Construction**

**Before ProofKit:**
- 4 hours per pour for manual curing documentation
- 12% failure rate due to calculation errors
- 3 re-pours annually costing $75,000 each
- Delayed project schedules waiting for validation

---

## The Solution

**ProofKit Implementation:**
- CSV upload from wireless concrete sensors (Sensotron ST-500)
- Automated ASTM C31 curing validation (temperature-time compliance)
- Maturity index calculation with degree-day accumulation
- Engineer-ready certificates with structural verification

**Key Features Used:**
- Temperature-time integration for strength development
- Maturity index calculation (Nurse-Saul equation)
- Early-age strength estimation from curing curves
- Weather compensation for ambient temperature effects

---

## The Results

**Quantified Impact:**
- **Documentation Time:** 4 hours → 35 minutes (85% reduction)
- **Specification Failures:** 12% → 0% (perfect compliance)
- **Cost Avoidance:** $225,000 in prevented re-pours
- **Schedule Improvement:** 2-day faster project completion

**Quality Assurance:**
- Real-time curing progress monitoring
- Early detection of temperature deviations
- Automated strength development tracking
- Professional documentation for structural engineers
