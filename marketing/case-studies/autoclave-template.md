# ProofKit Case Study: Autoclave Sterilization
*One-Page PDF Template for Healthcare & Laboratory Outreach*

---

## Client Success Story

**Company:** BioMed Labs (Contract Sterilization Facility)  
**Challenge:** Manual Fo value calculations for CFR 11 compliance  
**Solution:** ProofKit automated autoclave validation with integrated pressure monitoring  
**Result:** 90% faster validation, FDA inspection ready in minutes  

---

## The Challenge

> "Our sterilization cycles required complex Fo value calculations and pressure correlation analysis. Manual validation took our technicians 2-3 hours per batch, and FDA inspectors wanted immediate proof of sterility assurance. We needed CFR 11 compliance but couldn't afford a $50K validation system."
> 
> **— Dr. Jennifer Chen, Validation Manager, BioMed Labs**

**Before ProofKit:**
- 2.5 hours per batch for manual Fo calculations
- Risk of mathematical errors in sterility assurance
- Delayed batch release waiting for validation
- $125,000 quote for commercial validation software

---

## The Solution

**ProofKit Implementation:**
- Dual CSV upload: temperature and pressure data from Kaye validators
- Automated Fo value calculation with Z-value integration (121°C, D-value analysis)
- CFR 11 compliant documentation with audit trails
- Real-time sterility assurance validation

**Key Features Used:**
- Integrated temperature-pressure correlation analysis
- Fo value calculation with customizable Z-values
- Steam penetration time validation
- PDF/A-3 batch records with digital signatures

---

## The Results

**Quantified Impact:**
- **Validation Time:** 2.5 hours → 15 minutes (90% reduction)
- **Cost Savings:** $125,000 avoided in commercial software
- **Batch Throughput:** 40% increase in daily capacity
- **FDA Readiness:** Instant compliance documentation

**Quality Assurance:**
- Zero mathematical errors in Fo calculations
- Complete sterility assurance documentation
- Integrated pressure-temperature correlation
- Automatic deviation detection and flagging
