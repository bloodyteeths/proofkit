# ProofKit Case Study: Vaccine Cold Chain
*One-Page PDF Template for Pharmaceutical & Healthcare Outreach*

---

## Client Success Story

**Company:** CommunityHealth Pharmacy Network (15 locations)  
**Challenge:** Manual USP 797 cold chain documentation for vaccine storage  
**Solution:** ProofKit automated 2-8°C compliance with excursion analysis  
**Result:** 100% CDC audit compliance, $50K insurance claim recovery  

---

## The Challenge

> "Managing vaccine cold chain logs across 15 pharmacy locations was overwhelming. Each site had different refrigeration monitoring, manual temperature logs were incomplete, and we lost $50,000 in vaccines due to an undocumented excursion. CDC audits required perfect documentation we couldn't provide manually."
> 
> **— Dr. Amanda Foster, Pharmacy Director, CommunityHealth Network**

**Before ProofKit:**
- 6 hours weekly per location for manual temperature logging
- 30% incomplete documentation during CDC audits
- $50,000 vaccine loss due to undetected temperature excursion
- Risk of losing VFC (Vaccines for Children) program participation

---

## The Solution

**ProofKit Implementation:**
- CSV upload from Dickson temperature loggers across all locations
- Automated USP 797 compliance validation (2-8°C storage requirements)
- Real-time excursion detection with potency impact analysis
- CDC-ready documentation with complete audit trails

**Key Features Used:**
- Continuous 2-8°C range monitoring with ±0.1°C accuracy
- Temperature excursion analysis with duration impact
- Vaccine potency risk assessment using WHO stability data
- Multi-location centralized monitoring dashboard

---

## The Results

**Quantified Impact:**
- **Documentation Time:** 90 hours/week → 3 hours/week (97% reduction)
- **CDC Compliance:** 70% → 100% audit success rate
- **Insurance Recovery:** $50,000 claimed and recovered with ProofKit evidence
- **VFC Program:** Maintained participation across all locations

**Cold Chain Integrity:**
- Zero undetected temperature excursions
- Immediate alerts for refrigeration failures
- Complete potency preservation documentation
- Automated corrective action logging
