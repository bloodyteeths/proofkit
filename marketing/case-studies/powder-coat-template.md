# ProofKit Case Study: Powder-Coat Manufacturing
*One-Page PDF Template for Industry Outreach*

---

## Client Success Story

**Company:** MetalFinish Pro (Industrial Coating Facility)  
**Challenge:** Manual Qualicoat audit preparation taking 8+ hours per batch  
**Solution:** ProofKit automated ISO 2368 compliance validation  
**Result:** 95% time reduction, zero audit failures in 6 months  

---

## The Challenge

> "Our QA team was spending entire days creating cure certificates for Qualicoat audits. We had Excel templates, but every batch required manual threshold calculations, temperature graphs, and hold-time verification. One mistake meant failed audits and expensive re-work."
> 
> **— Sarah Mitchell, Quality Manager, MetalFinish Pro**

**Before ProofKit:**
- 8 hours per batch for manual certificate creation
- 15% error rate in threshold calculations
- Failed 2 Qualicoat audits due to documentation gaps
- $12,000 annual cost for QA overtime

---

## The Solution

**ProofKit Implementation:**
- CSV upload from existing Omega data loggers
- Automated ISO 2368 cure validation (180°C, 10-minute hold)
- PDF/A-3 tamper-proof certificates with SHA-256 verification
- One-click compliance reports for auditors

**Key Features Used:**
- Conservative threshold calculation (target + sensor uncertainty)
- Hysteresis control (2°C) for temperature fluctuations
- Continuous hold-time validation with visual proof
- QR code linking to blockchain-verified evidence

---

## The Results

**Quantified Impact:**
- **Time Savings:** 8 hours → 30 seconds (99.9% reduction)
- **Error Rate:** 15% → 0% (perfect accuracy)
- **Audit Success:** 6 consecutive passed Qualicoat inspections
- **Cost Savings:** $12,000 → $840 annually (93% reduction)

**Process Improvement:**
- Real-time PASS/FAIL validation during cure cycles
- Automatic archival with tamper-proof evidence
- Inspector-ready reports with embedded verification
- Seamless integration with existing data loggers
