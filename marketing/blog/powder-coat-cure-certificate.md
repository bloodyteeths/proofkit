# How to Prove a Powder-Coat Cure (ISO 2368) in One Click

Getting a powder coat cure certificate that meets ISO 2368 standards used to mean hours of Excel work, manual calculations, and endless formatting. Not anymore. Whether you're preparing for a Qualicoat audit or need inspector-ready documentation, ProofKit converts your temperature logger CSV into a compliant PDF certificate in under 30 seconds.

## The Challenge with Traditional Powder Coat Cure Validation

Powder coating quality depends on achieving the right temperature for the right duration. ISO 2368 and industry standards like Qualicoat require precise documentation showing:

- **Target temperature reached** (typically 180°C-200°C)
- **Adequate hold time** (usually 10-20 minutes above threshold)
- **Sensor accuracy validation** (±2°C uncertainty accounted for)
- **Continuous monitoring** without significant temperature dips
- **Ramp rate compliance** (controlled heating, not thermal shock)

Most manufacturers collect this data with PMT sensors or data loggers, but turning raw CSV files into audit-ready certificates involves tedious manual work prone to calculation errors.

## How ProofKit Automates Powder Coat Cure Proof

ProofKit follows the exact algorithms specified in ISO 2368 and Qualicoat guidelines:

1. **Conservative threshold calculation**: Target temperature + sensor uncertainty (e.g., 180°C + 2°C = 182°C)
2. **Hysteresis logic**: Prevents false passes from brief temperature spikes
3. **Continuous hold validation**: Measures the longest uninterrupted period above threshold
4. **Ramp rate analysis**: Ensures controlled heating (typically <15°C/min)
5. **Time-to-threshold measurement**: Validates efficient oven performance

The output is a tamper-evident PDF/A-3 certificate with:
- Clear PASS/FAIL determination
- Temperature vs. time plot with threshold lines
- Summary table of all critical measurements
- SHA-256 hash for verification
- QR code linking to validation portal

## Real-World Example: Automotive Wheel Coating

Consider a premium automotive wheel coating batch requiring 180°C for 10 minutes. Your PMT sensors record temperatures every 30 seconds throughout the cure cycle.

**Input**: CSV file with timestamp, pmt_sensor_1, pmt_sensor_2 columns
**Spec**: Target 180°C, 10-minute hold, ±2°C sensor uncertainty
**Output**: Inspector-ready certificate showing PASS/FAIL status

The ProofKit certificate includes the actual metrics:
- Hold time achieved: 12.5 minutes
- Peak temperature: 184.2°C
- Ramp rate: 8.7°C/min
- Time to threshold: 6.2 minutes
