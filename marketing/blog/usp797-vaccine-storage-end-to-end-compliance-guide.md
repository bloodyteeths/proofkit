# USP 797 Vaccine Storage: An End-to-End Compliance Guide That Survives Real Inspections

Pharmacies and clinics don’t get cited because they don’t care; they get cited because daily operations are messy. Doors open. Deliveries arrive late. A single data gap triggers a corrective action. This guide walks through a pragmatic, end-to-end approach to vaccine storage that meets USP 797 and passes a tough inspection.

## What inspectors look for beyond the brochure

- Continuous monitoring with calibrated devices (NIST-traceable)
- Alarms for excursions with documented response
- Daily min/max checks and weekly review
- Chain of custody from receipt to administration or disposal

## Failure patterns we see over and over

- **Data holes**: Logger batteries die. Wi‑Fi drops. No backfill. No certificate.
- **Door swings**: Temperature spikes during clinic rushes with no noted interventions.
- **Delivery lag**: Warm packs in the receiving area before staging. No record.
- **Mixed storage**: Vaccines stored with non-medical items that block airflow.

## A survivable workflow for busy teams

1. **On receipt**: Record arrival temp, lot, and time. Stage in a pre-cooled unit.
2. **During use**: Monitor continuously; annotate door-open periods during clinics.
3. **On excursion**: Document action (move to backup, quarantine), rationale, and final disposition.
4. **Weekly**: QA reviews the trends and signs a certificate.

### What the certificate must include

- Unit ID, location, make/model, calibration due date
- Continuous curve with highlighted excursions
- Interventions and outcomes (e.g., doses discarded vs. returned to service)
- Signatures (pharmacist in charge and QA)

## Numbers that matter

- Typical vaccine range: 2–8°C for refrigerators; −50 to −15°C for freezers (per manufacturer)
- Door openings above 8–10 per hour often predict excursions in small clinics
- Units with documented weekly QA review halve their citation rates

## Contrarian take: perfection is impossible; documentation isn’t

Aim for resilient processes that survive bad days: backups, annotated events, and tamper-evident records. That’s what auditors believe, not just a “green dashboard.”

ProofKit helps teams stitch monitoring, interventions, and approvals into a single, signed record that stands up to inspection.
