# ASTM C31: The Temperature Mistakes That Ruin Cylinder Strength (and How to Fix Them Fast)

When cylinders break low, it’s not always mix design — it’s curing conditions. Most labs and field teams know this, but records are thin when contractors push jobs hard. Here’s a practical guide for keeping cylinders within ASTM C31 temperature limits and proving it with a defensible record.

## The non-negotiables from ASTM C31

- Initial cure: 16–27°C (60–80°F) for up to 48 hours, protected from vibration and moisture loss
- Transport without freezing or overheating
- Final cure in lime-saturated water at 23±2°C until test

Auditors and engineers don’t just want compliant practice; they want proof tied to a placement.

## Where field practice breaks down

- Cylinders stored in pickup beds (temperature swings) before pickup
- Early-morning pours near freezing without insulation
- Hot-weather pours with cylinders left in direct sun
- Temperature measured “once” — no curve, no timestamps

## A simple, repeatable workflow

1. Place cylinders and immediately stage them in an insulated container.
2. Log a temperature curve for the first 24–48 hours with a probe inside the container.
3. Capture transport start/stop times and container temperature upon pickup and delivery.
4. Generate a certificate linked to the pour (slump, air, location), with pass/fail against C31.

### What a strong certificate contains

- Project and placement ID, mix, weather conditions
- Temperature curve for initial cure with pass/fail window shading
- Transport timeline and spot checks
- Final lab receipt confirmation
- Signatures from contractor and lab

## Numbers that matter in disputes

- Cylinders cured at 40–50°F can lose 10–20% strength at 7 days.
- Exceeding 80°F in the first 24 hours increases variability — even if the mean holds.
- Documented compliant curing reduces low-break disputes by half.

## Contrarian advice: stop chasing precision in the field, chase evidence

You don’t need continuous sensors on every cylinder. You need one reliable container curve tied to the batch, plus a signed chain of custody. That ends arguments faster than any technician email thread.

## Get this running in a week

- Day 1: Assign insulated containers and label them by crew
- Day 2: Configure pass/fail windows and QR the certificate
- Day 3–5: Run three pours, review the records with the lab, and lock the process

ProofKit validates your temperature curve against ASTM C31 and produces a tamper-evident certificate tied to the pour. When the break report is questioned, you show the record — not a memory.
