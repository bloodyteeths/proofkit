# Concrete Cylinder Curing Log: ASTM C31 Ready-Made PDF

Construction quality control demands precise concrete curing documentation, especially for critical infrastructure projects where cylinder strength testing determines structural integrity. ASTM C31 requires continuous temperature monitoring during the initial 48-hour curing period, but manual log creation is time-intensive and error-prone. ProofKit automates this validation, converting temperature logger data into construction-ready certificates that meet ASTM standards.

## Understanding ASTM C31 Curing Requirements

ASTM C31 "Standard Practice for Making and Curing Concrete Test Specimens in the Field" mandates specific temperature control during initial curing:

**Temperature range**: 60-80°F (16-27°C) continuously for first 48 hours
**Humidity requirements**: Maintain saturated moisture conditions
**Documentation**: Complete temperature record with timestamps
**Deviation limits**: Temperature excursions must be documented and justified

These requirements ensure that test cylinders cure under controlled conditions that accurately represent in-place concrete performance. Temperature variations outside this range can significantly affect compressive strength results, potentially invalidating expensive cylinder tests.

## The Challenge with Manual Curing Documentation

Traditional concrete curing monitoring involves:
- Manual temperature readings every 4-8 hours
- Paper log sheets prone to transcription errors  
- Time-consuming chart creation for project documentation
- Difficulty identifying temperature excursions in large datasets
- Labor-intensive report formatting for engineering review

This manual process is particularly challenging for:
- Overnight and weekend monitoring periods
- Multi-day projects with dozens of cylinder sets
- Projects requiring detailed temperature deviation analysis

## How ProofKit Automates ASTM C31 Compliance

ProofKit implements construction industry algorithms with full ASTM C31 compliance:

1. **Temperature range validation**: Continuous monitoring of 60-80°F requirement
2. **Excursion detection**: Automatic identification of out-of-range periods
3. **Duration analysis**: Calculates total time within and outside specification
4. **Statistical summary**: Mean, min, max temperatures with timestamps
5. **Visual documentation**: Temperature trend charts with ASTM limits highlighted

**Input format**: CSV with timestamp, temperature data (°F or °C)
**Output**: Construction-ready PDF with PASS/FAIL determination, temperature plots, and detailed statistics

## Real-World Example: Bridge Deck Construction

A DOT bridge project requires strength testing of concrete cylinders cast during a critical deck pour. Cylinders must cure at controlled temperatures for 48 hours before transport to the testing laboratory.

**Challenge**: Manual monitoring requires technician visits every 4 hours over the weekend, with temperature recordings and deviation calculations consuming additional project time.

**ProofKit solution**: Wireless data logger records temperatures every 15 minutes. Upload the CSV file to receive instant validation showing:
- Average temperature: 72.3°F (within range)
- Temperature excursions: 2.1% of total time (minimal impact)
- Minimum temperature: 58.9°F at 3:15 AM (brief excursion documented)
- Maximum temperature: 81.2°F at 2:45 PM (brief excursion documented)
- Overall compliance: PASS with minor deviations noted

The certificate includes a 48-hour temperature plot clearly showing the ASTM limits and any excursions, ready for inclusion in project quality documentation.
