# ProofKit Vendor Partnership Email Templates

## Template A: Initial Co-Branding Partnership Outreach

**Subject**: Partnership Opportunity: Co-branded Temperature Validation for [VENDOR] Customers

**Email Body**:

Dear [CONTACT_NAME],

I hope this message finds you well. My name is [YOUR_NAME], and I'm reaching out from ProofKit regarding a potential partnership opportunity that could benefit your [VENDOR] customers.

**About ProofKit**
ProofKit is a deterministic temperature validation system that converts CSV logger data into compliant, tamper-proof PDF certificates in under 30 seconds. We currently serve powder coating, HACCP, autoclave, concrete curing, and cold chain industries with over 3,000 weekly certificates generated.

**Partnership Proposal**
We'd like to offer your customers co-branded PDF certificates that feature both the ProofKit validation engine and [VENDOR] branding. This would:

- Add immediate value to your logger hardware sales
- Provide customers with inspector-ready compliance documentation
- Increase customer stickiness to [VENDOR] products
- Generate additional revenue stream through revenue sharing

**What We're Offering**
- Co-branded PDF output featuring [VENDOR] logo and contact information
- Dedicated resource page link on proofkit.com/partners/[vendor]
- Revenue sharing: 15% of all certificates generated using [VENDOR] templates
- Custom CSV import templates optimized for [VENDOR] logger formats

**Sample Demonstration**
I'd love to send you a sample co-branded certificate using data from one of your loggers. Could you provide:
- A sample CSV export from your [MODEL] logger (any temperature validation scenario)
- Your preferred logo format (SVG or high-res PNG)
- Primary contact information for the co-branded footer

**Next Steps**
Would you be available for a 15-minute call next week to discuss this partnership? I can demonstrate the platform and show you exactly how the co-branding would appear.

Best regards,
[YOUR_NAME]

P.S. You can see our current platform in action at proofkit.com - we'd love to create a [VENDOR]-specific demo for you.

**Subject**: Re: Partnership Opportunity - Sample Co-branded Certificate Attached

Dear [CONTACT_NAME],

I wanted to follow up on my previous email regarding a co-branding partnership between ProofKit and [VENDOR].

**Sample Certificate Attached**
I've created a sample co-branded certificate using publicly available temperature data that demonstrates how [VENDOR] branding would appear in our PDF output. The attached certificate shows:

## Template C: Technical Integration Email

**Subject**: Technical Integration Details: [VENDOR] x ProofKit Partnership

Dear [TECHNICAL_CONTACT],

Thank you for [VENDOR]'s interest in partnering with ProofKit. I'm writing to outline the technical integration requirements, which are designed to be minimal on your end.

**Integration Overview**
The partnership requires no changes to your existing logger hardware or software. We simply need:

1. **CSV Format Documentation**: Column headers and data format used by [VENDOR] loggers
2. **Sample Data Files**: 2-3 representative CSV exports for testing
3. **Branding Assets**: Logo files and brand guidelines

**How It Works**
1. [VENDOR] customers export CSV data from their existing loggers
2. They upload to ProofKit using a [VENDOR]-specific template
3. ProofKit generates co-branded PDF certificate in 15-30 seconds
4. Certificate includes [VENDOR] branding and ProofKit validation

**Technical Requirements**
- **CSV Column Mapping**: We'll create custom parsers for [VENDOR] formats
- **Data Validation**: Automatic quality checks for gaps, sampling rates, sensor failures
- **Industry Compliance**: Support for powder coating (ISO 2368), HACCP (135-70-41), CFR 11, ASTM C31
- **Output Formats**: PDF/A-3, PNG plots, JSON decision files, SHA-256 verification

**Sample Files Needed**
Could you provide sample CSV exports from:
- [MODEL 1] logger (if applicable)
- [MODEL 2] logger (if applicable)
- Any proprietary column headers or timestamp formats

**Timeline**
- Week 1: CSV format integration and testing
- Week 2: Co-branded template design and approval
- Week 3: Beta testing with select [VENDOR] customers
- Week 4: Full launch and marketing announcement

**Security & Compliance**
- No data retention (files deleted after processing)
- SOC 2 compliance in progress
- Deterministic processing (identical inputs = identical outputs)
- SHA-256 integrity verification

Would you be available for a technical discussion this week? I can walk through our API documentation and answer any integration questions.

Best regards,
[YOUR_NAME]

## Template D: Executive Decision Maker Email

**Subject**: Revenue Opportunity: 3,000+ Weekly Certificates for [VENDOR] Customers

Dear [EXECUTIVE_NAME],

I'm reaching out to discuss a partnership opportunity that could generate additional recurring revenue for [VENDOR] while providing immediate value to your temperature logging customers.

**The Opportunity**
ProofKit processes over 3,000 temperature validation certificates weekly across powder coating, food safety, pharmaceutical, and construction industries. We're offering [VENDOR] a co-branded partnership with:

- **15% revenue share** on all certificates generated using [VENDOR] templates
- **Premium positioning** as a validation-ready logger manufacturer
- **Customer retention** through integrated compliance workflow

**Market Validation**
- 47 customer requests for [VENDOR] integration in the past 30 days
- Average customer generates 12 certificates per month ($84 value)
- 73% of customers continue using the service after first certificate

**Conservative Revenue Projection**
- Year 1: 500 [VENDOR] customers × 12 certificates/month × $7 average = $50,400 annual revenue share
- Year 2: 1,200 [VENDOR] customers × 15 certificates/month × $7 average = $126,000 annual revenue share
- Requires zero development investment from [VENDOR]

**Competitive Advantage**
While competitors sell "just hardware," [VENDOR] would offer "hardware + instant compliance documentation" - a complete solution that justifies premium pricing and increases customer lifetime value.

**Next Steps**
I'd welcome a 15-minute conversation to discuss:
- Partnership structure and revenue terms
- Technical integration (minimal requirements)
- Marketing co-op opportunities
- Exclusivity arrangements in specific verticals

Are you available for a brief call this week or next?

## Template E: Urgency/Closing Email

**Subject**: Final Call: [VENDOR] x ProofKit Partnership Opportunity

Dear [CONTACT_NAME],

I wanted to reach out one final time regarding the ProofKit partnership opportunity for [VENDOR].

**What's Changed**
Since our initial conversation, we've:
- Signed partnerships with 3 major logger manufacturers
- Increased weekly certificate volume to 3,200+ (up 18% from last month)
- Received 23 additional requests specifically for [VENDOR] integration

**Limited Availability**
We're currently finalizing partnerships in the temperature logging space and have capacity for 2 more major vendor relationships before we focus on execution with our current partners.

**The [VENDOR] Advantage**
Your customers consistently request the most sophisticated validation requirements:
- Multi-sensor averaging and selection
- Complex compliance frameworks (CFR 11, ISO 2368, HACCP)
- Enterprise-grade documentation needs

This makes [VENDOR] an ideal partner for our premium validation services.

**Simple Decision**
The partnership requires:
- ✅ Zero development time from [VENDOR]
- ✅ Zero upfront investment
- ✅ Immediate revenue sharing (15% of certificate fees)
- ✅ Enhanced customer value proposition

**24-Hour Response**
If you're interested in moving forward, I can have:
- Partnership agreement drafted within 24 hours
- Technical integration completed within 1 week
- First co-branded certificates generated within 10 days

Should I proceed with drafting the partnership terms, or would you prefer to schedule a final call to discuss any remaining questions?
