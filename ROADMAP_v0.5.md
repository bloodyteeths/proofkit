# ProofKit v0.5 – Multi-Module & Compliance Roadmap  
*Target release: 4 weeks after v0.1 production deploy*

---

## 0. Scope Overview
| Area | Goal |
|------|------|
| **Modules** | Add 5 new industries: HACCP cook/chill, Pharma Autoclave, Medical EtO Sterile, Concrete Cure (ASTM C31), Cold-Chain Fridge (USP <797>). |
| **Compliance** | Certificates upgraded to PDF/A-3 + embedded SHA-256 manifest + RFC 3161 timestamp. Optional DocuSign signature page; IQ/OQ/PQ validation-pack ZIP. |
| **UX** | Module-preset selector in GUI & CLI; magic-link auth with Operator vs QA roles. |
| **Infra** | Keep stateless container + Fly.io volume; no DB (job meta JSON). Deterministic outputs preserved. |
