## Test Matrix Results

### Industry Coverage

| Industry | Pass Test | Fail Test | Status |
|----------|-----------|-----------|---------|
| **Powder Coating** | ❌ FAIL (Expected PASS)* | ✅ FAIL (Correct) | ⚠️ Partial |
| **Autoclave** | ❌ HTTP 400 | ❌ HTTP 400 | ❌ Failed |

  - Insufficient continuous hold time: 450s < 600s
- ✅ QR code present for verification
- ✅ Verification hash displayed: c7aa3e11d0c0be70...69596284cac7e020
- ✅ Signature blocks for Process Engineer and Quality Manager

### Powder Coating - Expected Fail
**Job ID:** 245e88f31f  
**PDF Size:** 10,528 bytes  
**Status:** FAIL  

**Key Observations:**
- ✅ Consistent PDF formatting with first test
- ✅ FAIL banner properly displayed
- ✅ Even shorter hold time (150s vs 600s required)
- ✅ Decision reasons:
  - Ramp rate too high: 34.6°C/min > 15.0°C/min
  - Insufficient continuous hold time: 150s < 600s
- ✅ Unique verification hash: ceaebed0479a4599...0f5c5e923971ab24
- ✅ Timestamp shows generation at 2025-08-08 22:21:27 UTC

## Evidence Bundle Analysis

### Bundle Structure
Both bundles contained the expected file structure:
- `inputs/raw_data.csv` - Original uploaded CSV
- `inputs/specification.json` - Specification used
- `manifest.json` - File manifest with hashes
- `outputs/decision.json` - Decision logic results
- `outputs/normalized_data.csv` - Processed data
- `outputs/plot.png` - Temperature plot
- `outputs/proof.pdf` - Generated PDF certificate

### Verification Issues
- ❌ Hash verification failed for both bundles
- ❌ Root hash not properly computed
- ❌ Manifest parsing errors encountered
- ⚠️ Bundle integrity cannot be fully verified

## UI Smoke Test Results

**Overall Pass Rate:** 87.5% (7/8 tests passed)

### Page Status
- ✅ **Homepage:** Loaded successfully with hero and copy
- ✅ **Examples Page:** All industry cards displayed
- ✅ **Powder Coating:** Industry page loaded
- ❌ **Autoclave:** Page failed to load (404 or content issue)
- ✅ **Cold Chain:** Industry page loaded
- ✅ **HACCP:** Industry page loaded  
- ✅ **Concrete:** Industry page loaded
- ✅ **ETO:** Industry page loaded

## API Response Analysis

### Successful Response Structure (Powder Coating)
```json

  "id": "e386178fa2",
  "pass": false,
  "status": "FAIL",
  "metrics": {
    "target_temp_C": 180.0,

    "pdf": "/download/e386178fa2/pdf",
    "zip": "/download/e386178fa2/zip"
  },
  "verification_hash": "..."
}
```

### Failed Industries (HTTP 400)
All non-powder industries returned HTTP 400 errors, suggesting:
- Missing or incompatible specification format
- Industry-specific endpoints not fully implemented
- Validation logic rejecting synthetic data format

## Data Quality Assessment

### Test Data Used

#### Real-World Data (Powder Coating)
- ✅ `powder_coat_cure_successful_180c_10min_pass.csv` - Actual sensor data
- ✅ `powder_coat_cure_insufficient_hold_time_fail.csv` - Actual failure case

#### Synthetic Data (Other Industries)
- Generated programmatically with numpy
- Designed to create specific PASS/FAIL conditions
- May not match expected API format for these industries

## Recommendations

### Critical Issues
1. **Fix Industry Support:** Implement/fix API endpoints for autoclave, coldchain, HACCP, concrete, and sterile industries
2. **Bundle Verification:** Fix manifest hash computation and verification logic
3. **Test Data:** Review powder coating "pass" test data - currently failing due to ramp rate

### High Priority
1. **API Documentation:** Document required specification format for each industry
2. **Error Messages:** Provide more descriptive error messages for HTTP 400 responses
3. **UI Consistency:** Fix autoclave industry page loading issue

### Medium Priority
1. **Performance:** Current response time ~2-3 seconds per request could be optimized
2. **Validation:** Add client-side validation before API submission
3. **Testing:** Expand test coverage with more edge cases

## Conclusion

The ProofKit platform successfully generates PDF certificates and evidence bundles for powder coating applications. The PDF quality is professional with proper formatting, clear PASS/FAIL indicators, and verification features. However, support for other industries needs implementation or debugging.

The system correctly applies validation logic, identifying ramp rate violations and insufficient hold times. The authentication system works properly with magic links and session cookies.

### Overall Assessment
- **Strengths:** PDF generation, validation logic, authentication
- **Weaknesses:** Limited industry support, bundle verification, test data quality
- **Score:** 2/12 tests fully passed (16.7%)

### Audit Trail
- Audit logs saved to: `live_runs/20250809_010745/`
- PDFs archived: 2 certificates
- Bundles archived: 2 evidence packages
- Response data: JSON files for each test
